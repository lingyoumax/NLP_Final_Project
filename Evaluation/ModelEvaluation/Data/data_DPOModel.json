        "output": "NART/WTAR scores refer to neurobehavioral assessment rating scales used to assess cognitive abilities in individuals. These scores can be used to estimate an individual's premorbid abilities, particularly those related to verbal comprehension and general ability. The variability in correlations between NART/WTAR scores and individual WAIS-IV indices suggests that these scores may be particularly useful for estimating crystallized premorbid abilities compared to fluid abilities such as working memory and perceptual reasoning."
