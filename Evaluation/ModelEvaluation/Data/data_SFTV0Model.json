It refers to the practice of parents monitoring their child's activities and behaviors, as well as using surveillance technology to track their movements and online activity. Factors that increase the risk of developing PMU in children include experiencing negative psychological symptoms, having a dysfunctional parent-child relationship, and facing difficulties in school context. Additionally, an authoritative parenting style and restrictive parental mediation can reduce the risk of developing PMU. Finally, there are limited self-report measures available specifically designed for young children."
