# QA fintuen using Qwen-7B-Chat[^1]
## 1. Dataset optimization
### I. Generation of more data sets：
Use the self instuct[^2] method to generate the data set using the QA seed library we concocted.But in contrast to the generation for generic domains used in the original approach, we set the INSTRUCTION to the relevant statement segment, the INPUT to the different types of questions, and the OUTPUT to the corresponding answers. Similarly it is also categorized into judgmental and non-judgmental questions.
### II.MoDS filter dataset
Using the MoDS[^3] method to filter out higher quality datasets.

## 2.Model training
### II. supervised fine-tuning(SFT folder)
- a.We used the enhanced dataset obtained earlier to accomplish this step of fine-tuning.
- b.Quantization at model load due to resource issues
- c.Compared to full fine-tuning, we use the adapter[^4] approach which is less memory intensive and more efficient.
### III.Reward model fine-tuning(Reward folder)
- a.Our reward model is based on the Qwen_SFT trained in the previous step to select the last layer of lm_head, and uses a new v_head layer (full linear) as the reward model.
- b.In the construction of the data set, we used self instruct to construct a large number of questions, and then used Qwen_SFT to generate different answers based on random parameters such as temperature and top_p. Then use GPT3.5 as the reply scoring machine. So we have a training data set.
- c.In addition, we use 8000 of full-hh-rlhf[^5] as an additional training data set.
- d.For some other parameters, see the corresponding global_config.py.
### IV. DPO (DPO folder)
- a.Compared with ppo, we chose the more memory-saving dpo method for further fine-tuning.
- b.Here we use the trl[^6] library to complete this part of the work

## 2.Environment Configuration
- a.Training configuration
  - random access memory (RAM):Minimum 15GB
  - Display card：4090,24GB(for training, at least 15GB)
- b.Inference Configuration
  -  random access memory (RAM):Minimum 5GB
  -  Display card：4090,24GB(for inference, at least 12GB, if for batch inference, Recommended minimum 18GB)
## 4.How to use
- a. build dataset
  - can see dataset_optimization
- b.supervised fine-tuning:
  - find the SFT-fintune
  - if want to train a new lora model, set global_configs.lora_model="", and use "python train.py"
  - if want to continue train the lora model, down load the lora model from link in SFT_fintune/lora_out/Qwen_sft/out, set global_configs.lora_model="Qwen_sft_out", and use "python train.py"
- c.reward model

- d.DPO

## 5. Pipeline
- a.RejectSampling[^7]
  - Here we use two training methods. First, we perform multiple inferences on the SFT model to obtain several responses, which are sent to the rm model for scoring. The response with the highest score for each question is selected as the answer to the question, and then fine-tuned again.
- b.DPO
  - Here, a pair is composed of the response generated by the previous version and the response generated by the latest SFT fine-tuning version, and then the DPO method is used for fine-tuning.
